There are currently both Java and JavaScript implementations of the same functionality.

If asked to implement a 4 variable min function with a 8:1 MUX then this program will compute which values to connect to the 8 inputs of the MUX.

E.g. the function F(a,b,c,d) = Î£m(0,4,5,8,9,12,13,14,15) is the one being computed by default. Simply change the `minterms` array to include the desired minterm set to get the input values for the desired function.

A table describing the same functionality as the program with the same default minterms:
