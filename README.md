There are currently both Java and JavaScript implementations of this project. The Java implementation has more functionality. The JavaScript implementation assumes a 4 variable min function being mapped to a 8:1 MUX. The Java implementation can work with various other variable amounts. It reads the variable count and minterms from a text file (input1.txt by default) and computes which values to connect to which inputs for the smallest single MUX that can handle that many variables.

E.g. the function F(a,b,c,d) = Î£m(0,4,5,8,9,12,13,14,15) is the one being computed by default.

The program output given the above minterms and a variable count of 4:
